# Deploy 1 thousand pods in my JUST laptop (w/ kwok)

Speaker: Hoon Jo

## Why use kwok to deploy kubernetes

> KWOK is a toolkit that enables setting up a cluster of thousands of Nodes in seconds. Under the scene, all Nodes are simulated to behave like real ones, so the overall approach employs a pretty low resource footprint that you can easily play around on your laptop.

Kwok 只是一個模擬的工具。模擬不需要 resource ，所以可以節省很多資源。
